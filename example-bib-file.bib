      abstract = {Nuclear power currently supports the goals of the European Union low-carbon society by being a dependable source of energy, while emitting no CO2. In the future, more flexible nuclear systems could enable wind to achieve a 50{\%} share of the renewable contribution to the energy mix. Small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) could provide firming power generation to back-up the supply from renewable resources and follow-load. This study involves the hypothetical combination of an off-shore wind farm and a SMR, operated together as a virtual power plant (VPP). Results using wind data from the North Sea indicate that the combination results in 80{\%} less wind power variation to the grid, effectively creating a virtual baseload power plant. This gain comes at the loss of 30{\%} SMR capacity utilization. The research identified that the reduction of 1000MW off-shore wind farm variability was best achieved with 700MW SMRs using 100MW modules. In demand-following mode the VPP could maneuver output to improve synchronization with demand by 60–70{\%} over a wind-only system. Power variability was indifferent to the SMR module size. The VPP could not reduce 100{\%} of the wind variation, as additional balancing measures (e.g., smart grid, storage, and hybrid-nuclear systems) are still needed.},

      abstract = {Future plans for energy production in the European Union as well as other locations call for a high penetration of renewable technologies (20{\%} by 2020, and higher after 2020). The remaining energy requirements will be met by fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Smaller, less-capital intensive nuclear reactors are emerging as an alternative to fossil fuel and large nuclear systems. Approximately 50 small ({\textless}300 MWe) to medium-sized ({\textless}700 MWe) reactors (SMRs) concepts are being pursued for use in electricity and cogeneration (combined heat and power) markets. However, many of the SMRs are at the early design stage and full data needed for economic analysis or market assessment is not yet available. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop “target cost” estimates for reactors deployed in a range of competitive market situations (electricity prices ranging from 45–150 €/MWh). Parametric analysis was used to develop a cost breakdown for reactors that can compete against future natural gas and coal (with/without carbon capture) and large nuclear systems. Sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impacts on competitiveness from key cost variables. This study suggests that SMRs may effectively compete in future electricity markets if their capital costs are controlled, favorable financing is obtained, and reactor capacity factors match those of current light water reactors. This methodology can be extended to cogeneration markets supporting a range of process heat applications.},

abstract = {Stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems usually incur lower costs and demonstrate higher reliability than photovoltaic (PV) or wind systems. The most usual systems are PV–Wind–Battery and PV–Diesel–Battery. Energy storage is usually in batteries (normally of the lead-acid type). Another possible storage alternative, such as hydrogen, is not currently economically viable, given the high cost of the electrolyzers and fuel cells and the low efficiency in the electricity–hydrogen–electricity conversion. When the design of these systems is carried out, it is usually done resolve an optimization problem in which the Net Present Cost (NPC) is minimized or, in some cases, in relation to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE). The correct resolution of this optimization problem is a complex task because of the high number of variables and the non-linearity in the performance of some of the system components. This paper revises the simulation and optimization techniques, as well as the tools existing that are needed to simulate and design stand-alone hybrid systems for the generation of electricity.},

abstract = {Dynamic analysis of HES (hybrid energy systems) under flexible operation and variable renewable generation is considered in this two-part communication to better understand various challenges and opportunities associated with the high variability arising from integrating renewable energy into the power grid. Unique consequences are addressed by devising advanced HES solutions in which multiple forms of energy commodities, such as electricity and chemical products, may be exchanged. Dynamic models of various unit operations are developed and integrated within two different HES options. One HES option, termed traditional, produces electricity only and consists of a primary heat generator, a steam turbine generator, a wind farm, and a battery storage. The other HES option, termed advanced, includes not only the components present in the traditional option but also a chemical plant complex to repurpose excess energy for non-electricity services, such as for the production of chemical goods. In either case, a given HES is connected to the power grid at a point of common coupling and requested to deliver a certain electricity generation profile as dictated by a regional power grid operator based on a predicted demand curve. A dynamic performance analysis of these highly-coupled HES is conducted in this part one of the communication to identify their key dynamical properties and limitations and to prescribe solutions for best managing and mitigating the high variability introduced from incorporating renewable energy into the energy mix.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

The optimization loop is imple-mented in MATLAB, with the FMI Toolbox serving as the interface between the computational platforms. Two characteristic optimization problems are selected to demonstrate the methodology and gain insight into the system performance. The first is an unconstrained optimization problem that optimizes intrinsic proper-ties of the base generation, power cycle, and electri-cal storage components to minimize variability in the HES. The second problem takes operating and capital costs into consideration by imposing linear and non-linear constraints on the design variables. Variability in electrical power applied to high temperature steam electrolysis is shown to be reduced by 18{\%} in the un-constrained case and 11{\%} in the constrained case. The preliminary optimization results obtained in this study provide an essential step towards the development of a comprehensive framework for designing HES.},

Hybrid Energy Systems (HES) have as their defining characteristic the use of one or more energy inputs, combined with the potential for multiple energy outputs. Compared to traditional energy systems, HES provide addition-al operational flexibility so that high variability in both energy production and consumption levels can be absorbed more effectively. This is particularly important when including renewable energy sources, whose output levels are inherently variable, deter-mined by nature. The specific HES configuration modeled in this paper include two energy inputs: a nuclear plant, and a series of wind turbines. In addition, the system produces two energy outputs: electricity and synthet-ic fuel. The models are verified through simulations of the individual components, and the system as a whole.

To study the dynamic analysis of such system, special attention is given here to the detailed dynamic modeling and control design of RO desalination process that employs a spiral-wound membrane module. In particular, the solution-diffusion model modified with the concentration polarization theory is applied to predict RO performance over a large range of operating conditions. Simulation results involving several case studies suggest that an RO desalination plant can provide operational flexibility to participate in energy management at the utility scale by dynamically optimizing the use of excess electrical energy. The incorporation of additional commodity (fresh water) produced from a FLR allows a broader range of HES operations for maximizing overall system performance and profitability.},

abstract = {The energy industries face two sustainability challenges: the need to avoid climate change and the need to replace traditional crude oil as the basis of our transport system. Radical changes in our energy system will be required to meet these challenges. These challenges may require tight coupling of different energy sources (nuclear, fossil, and renewable) to produce liquid fuels for transportation, match electricity production to electricity demand, and meet other energy needs. This implies a paradigm shift in which different energy sources are integrated together, rather than being considered separate entities that compete. Several examples of combined-energy systems are described. High-temperature nuclear heat may increase worldwide light crude oil resources by an order of magnitude while reducing greenhouse gas releases from the production of liquid fossil fuels. Nuclear-biomass liquid-fuels production systems could potentially meet world needs for liquid transport fuels. Nuclear-hydrogen peak power systems may enable renewable electricity sources to meet much of the world's electric demand by providing electricity when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

With ground source heat pump (GSHP) as the main body and core technology, the hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) system is used frequently in recent years and its integration and synthesis skills face higher requirements. The worldwide hybrid system has usually been composed of types of energy source devices, such as solar collector, boiler (coal, gas, oil), electric heater, waste energy device, cooling tower, cooler, and thermal storage system with natural cold and hot. Actually, they lead to the complicated unsteady processes and various hybrid energy systems.

Meanwhile, the basic proposals for development in the future are presented to make up the gap in the field of HES and HGSHP. A coming work aims to research the basic problems during the demonstration application, such as investigation of system design parameters, component configuration and control strategies of a HGSHP system.

abstract = {The study was conducted for optimal design of hybrid power generation system (HPS) in which diesel generators and renewable energy generators are incorporated to supply electricity to islands isolated from the national grid. In order to optimally design capacity and operation planning of the hybrid system, hourly electricity demand data is needed over 8760h of a year. The required hourly data was simulated from monthly electricity consumption reports and EnergyPlus-based building models. An optimization method that matches hourly supply and demand may encounter problems of exhaustive computing time and ‘out of memory' because size of associated matrices increases in multiples of 8760×8760. The problems were resolved with sparse matrices and the linear programming algorithm. Linear constraints necessary for the linear programming were developed in this study. According to the simulation result with the target island (Deokjeok Island), the optimization method recommends a hybrid generation system rather than a conventional diesel only system due to high fuel cost. And the capacity design reflects renewable energy resources abundant in the island. And designed operation planning illustrates good hourly matching of demand and supply over 8760h with minimal excess electricity, which validates integrity of the proposed design method.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Hybrid energy systems consisting of multiple energy inputs and multiple energy outputs have been proposed to be an effective element to enable ever increasing penetration of clean energy. In order to better understand the dynamic and probabilistic behavior of hybrid energy systems, this paper proposes a model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) to characterize historical weather measurements and to generate synthetic weather (e.g., wind speed) data. In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system configuration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, economic and envi-ronmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.},

abstract = {We assess the feasibility of hybrid solar-biomass power plants for use in India in various applications including tri-generation, electricity generation and process heat. To cover this breadth of scenarios we analyse, with the help of simulation models, case studies with peak thermal capacities ranging from 2 to 10MW. Evaluations are made against technical, financial and environmental criteria. Suitable solar multiples, based on the trade-offs among the various criteria, range from 1 to 2.5. Compared to conventional energy sources, levelised energy costs are high – but competitive in comparison to other renewables such as photovoltaic and wind. Long payback periods for hybrid plants mean that they cannot compete directly with biomass-only systems. However, a 1.2–3.2 times increase in feedstock price will result in hybrid systems becoming cost competitive. Furthermore, in comparison to biomass-only, hybrid operation saves up to 29{\%} biomass and land with an 8.3–24.8{\$}/GJ/a and 1.8–5.2¢/kWh increase in cost per exergy loss and levelised energy cost. Hybrid plants will become an increasingly attractive option as the cost of solar thermal falls and feedstock, fossil fuel and land prices continue to rise. In the foreseeable future, solar will continue to rely on subsidies and it is recommended to subsidise preferentially tri-generation plants.},

This paper presents an economic analysis of the feasibility of utilizing a hybrid energy system consisting of solar, wind and diesel generators for application in remote areas of southern Ghana using levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and net present cost of the system. The annual daily average solar global radiation at the selected site is 5.4 kW h/m2/day and the annual mean wind speed is 5.11 m/s. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software was employed to carry out the present study. Both wind data and the actual load data have been used in the simulation model. It was found that a PV array of 80 kW, a 100 kW wind turbine, two generators with combined capacity of 100 kW, a 60 kW converter/inverter and a 60 Surrette 4KS25P battery produced a mix of 791.1 MW h of electricity annually. The cost of electricity for this hybrid system is found to be {\$}0.281/kW h. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of changes in wind speed, solar global radiation and diesel price on the optimal energy was investigated and the impact of solar PV price on the LCOE for a selected hybrid energy system was also presented.},

abstract = {Due to a lack of indigenous fossil energy resources, Ireland's energy supply constantly teeters on the brink of political, geopolitical, and geographical unease. The potential risk to the security of the energy supply combined with the contribution of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to climate change gives a clear indication of Ireland's need to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels as primary energy source. A feasibility analysis to investigate the available renewable energy options was conducted using HOMER software. The net present cost, the cost of energy, and the CO2 emissions of each potential energy combination were considered in determining the most suitable renewable and non-renewable hybrid energy system. Wind energy was shown to have the greatest potential for renewable energy generation in Ireland: wind energy was a component of the majority of the optimal hybrid systems both in stand-alone and grid-connected systems. In 2010 the contribution of wind energy to gross electricity consumption in Ireland approximated 10{\%}, and the results of this feasibility study indicate that there is great potential for wind-generated energy production in Ireland. Due to the inherent variability of wind energy the grid-connected system results are particularly relevant, which show that in more than half of the analyses investigating electrical energy demand the incorporation of wind energy offset the CO2 emissions of the non-renewable elements to such a degree that the whole system had negative CO2 emissions, which has serious implications for Kyoto Protocol emissions limits. Ireland also has significant potential for hydropower generation despite only accounting for 2{\%} of the gross electricity consumption in 2010. Wind and hydro energy should therefore be thoroughly explored to secure an indigenous primary energy source in Ireland.},

abstract = {Biomasses created from natural resources such as firewood, charcoal and forest crops are still the main source of energy in many communities in the developing countries of the world. The absence of modern techniques, in terms of energy conversion and the lack of resource planning, places a great burden on the environment, not only in terms of deforestation but the polluting residual emissions created by the burning of such fuels. Even in some developed countries, it is possible to find rural areas that have no access to the conventional national electrical grid. The lack of this facility is detrimental to the social and economic development of any country or community. Renewable energy systems have been used in many cases to mitigate these problems. The present paper introduces the concept of an alternative Hybrid Power System configuration that combines photovoltaic modules and digesters fuelled by goat manure as the basis for rural sustainable development. Attention is drawn to the Northeast Region of Brazil, one of the largest semi-arid regions in a single country. The regional conditions of Northeast of Brazil are not unique, suggesting that other countries of a similar nature would benefit from the same energy system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both models have been designed to predict the technical and economical (life cycle cost) performance of hybrid power plants that typically might be comprised of renewable energy sources, a battery bank, and a diesel generator. A South American (Brazil) based hybrid power system used to power a remote telecommunications system was used for the applications case study. A final system configuration be used as a basis for model prediction comparison was established as a result of HYBRID2 parametric evaluation. Both codes yielded similar performance results, and this work points out that the predicted performance discrepancies are due basically to different subcomponent models and differences in control strategy.

Simulations were performed in the Texas, US (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power meet up to 80{\%} of the electric demand. The primary constraints on incorporation of these sources at large scale are the limited time coincidence of the resource with normal electricity demand, combined with the limited flexibility of thermal generators to reduce output. An additional constraint in the ERCOT system is the current inability to exchange power with neighboring grids. By themselves, these constraints would result in unusable renewable generation and increased costs. But a highly flexible system – with must-run baseload generators virtually eliminated – allows for penetrations of up to about 50{\%} variable generation with curtailment rates of less than 10{\%}. For penetration levels up to 80{\%} of the system's electricity demand, keeping curtailments to less than 10{\%} requires a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about one day of average demand.},

abstract = {A strategy to enable zero-carbon variable electricity production with full utilization of renewable and nuclear energy sources has been developed. Wind and solar systems send electricity to the grid. Nuclear plants operate at full capacity with variable steam to turbines to match electricity demand with production (renewables and nuclear). Excess steam at times of low electricity prices and electricity demand go to hybrid fuel production and storage systems. The characteristic of these hybrid technologies is that the economic penalties for variable nuclear steam inputs are small. Three hybrid systems were identified that could be deployed at the required scale. The first option is the gigawatt-year hourly-to-seasonal heat storage system where excess steam from the nuclear plant is used to heat rock a kilometer underground to create an artificial geothermal heat source. The heat source produces electricity on demand using geothermal technology. The second option uses steam from the nuclear plant and electricity from the grid with high-temperature electrolysis (HTR) cells to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is primarily for industrial applications; however, the HTE can be operated in reverse using hydrogen for peak electricity production. The third option uses variable steam and electricity for shale oil production.},

abstract = {As the U.S. energy system evolves, the amount of electricity from variable-generation sources is likely to increase, which could result in additional times when electricity demand is lower than available production. Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

@article{Juchau2010,
abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements defined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be implemented using an interconnected architecture of different codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material movements. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncertainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclusion of an optimization engine able to optimize simultaneously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or discrete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the four functions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Hybrid energy systems consisting of multiple energy inputs and multiple energy outputs have been proposed to be an effective element to enable ever increasing penetration of clean energy. In order to better understand the dynamic and probabilistic behavior of hybrid energy systems, this paper proposes a model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) to characterize historical weather measurements and to generate synthetic weather (e.g., wind speed) data. In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system configuration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, economic and envi-ronmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.},

abstract = {As popular demand and regulation enable the rapid expansion of variable renewable generation, the electrical grid is seeing new challenges in providing reliable, stable electricity to customers. In order to meet these challenges, additional flexibility will need to be introduced to the electrical grid. Nuclear Hybrid Energy Systems are predicted to offer significant flexibility by combining some or all of renewable, fossil, and nuclear generation with energy storage and a secondary product production capability. This study aims to demonstrate the value of battery electric storage to such a nuclear hybrid system, as well as to examine the effectiveness of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) as a figure of merit for such a hybrid system. In this study, battery storage provided notable improvements in the utilization of variable wind generation. LCOE was found ineffective at capturing the benefits of storage and a revenue stream. i},

@article{Ingersoll2014_1,
abstract = {The worldwide demand for potable water has been steadily growing and is projected to accelerate while natural reserves of fresh water are generally flat or diminishing. Desalination of seawater or brackish groundwater is expected to make up the difference; however, the desalination of water is energy intensive, requiring large amounts of electricity and/or thermal energy. Nuclear energy is an attractive option for large scale desalination application since the thermal energy produced in a nuclear plant can provide both electricity and heat for clean water production without the emission of greenhouse gases or the variability of renewable sources. A particularly attractive option for nuclear desalination is to couple a desalination plant with a new generation of designs - small modular reactors. The NuScale small modular reactor design is especially well suited for the cogeneration of electricity and clean water because of the enhanced safety, improved affordability, and deployment flexibilities of the plant design, which provides a cost-effective approach to expanding global desalination capacity. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the technical and economic considerations of coupling a NuScale plant to a variety of different desalination technologies. The study concludes that although a NuScale plant coupled to a reverse osmosis desalination plant provides the most favorable economics, NuScale design features offer several flexibilities for coupling to thermal distillation plants and hybrid plant configurations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
