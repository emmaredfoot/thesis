Growing concerns over the impact of fossil fuels on climate change are driving efforts to use more low emission fuel sources. In response, fluctuating renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are growing to meet more of the electric demand. However, maintaining reliable energy accessibility to the grid requires a stable, dispatchable source of power. Nuclear power plants provide low emission, reliable energy to the grid \cite{IPCC}. To best reduce reliance on fossil fuels while ensuring reliable energy generation and profitability, Nuclear Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (NRHESs) focus on electrically and thermally coupling renewable generation with a nuclear power plant by co-locating the generation sources on an industrial park. The industrial park is comprised of at least the nuclear power plant, the renewable energy source, and some form of industrial process that consumes the energy not used by the grid. This thesis focuses on the potential economic and thermodynamic benefits of thermally coupling an industrial process to a nuclear power plant in a NRHES as opposed to electrically coupling. This paper analyzes the computational modeling approaches currently being pursued for NRHESs. Initially, the thesis begins by reviewing past research to determine the necessary software capabilities for an NRHES model. Then, with the help of an expert survey and the risk assessment techniques of Preliminary Hazards Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process, an industrial process with strong support for coupling with a generic NRHES model is determined. This thesis then describes an Aspen HYSYS models of a Palo Verde Generating Station reactor coupled to both a thermal multi-stage flash distillation water purification system as well as an electrically coupled reverse osmosis system. To compare the different couplings, this thesis applies an economic exergy analysis to the system. Finally, results and future research are discussed.

\chapter{Expert AHP Survey}

The description for the survey which includes all of the assumptions built into the survey is:

The following questionnaire will take 10 to 20 minutes to complete. Thank you for your time and consideration.

The questionnaire below is one part of my research evaluating the potential benefits of applying the risk assessment technique of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare different industrial processes that might be incorporated into a nuclear renewable hybrid energy system.  AHP requires a group of experts determining the relative values associated with each of the options being compared.  The questionnaire  requests your expert opinion on determining the values associated with thermally coupling a desalination plant, a synthetic fuels plant, and a hydrogen production plant to a nuclear power plant.  The three industrial processes are compared based on safety, flexibility, and economic value.

This survey assumes that the process used for hydrogen production is high temperature steam electrolysis with thermal as well as electrical coupling to the nuclear power plant.  The assumed form of desalination is thermal desalination through distillation directly using heat from the nuclear power plant.  The assumed synthetic fuel process is a Fischer-Tropsch method using coal as the hydrocarbon source.  Assume each of the processes consumes the same amount of heat from the nuclear power plant.

The questions below deal with the relative value of each of the industrial processes based on each of the characteristics taken into consideration in this study: safety, ability to fluctuate, and profitability. Ability to fluctuate describes how difficult it is to start and stop the industrial process, as well as the ability of the industrial process to ramp to allow more or less heat to be allocated to electricity production to match demand from the grid. For example, if the process can start and stop, but the initial batch of product is of lower quality, that would negatively affect the "ability to fluctuate" as compared to a process that could start and stop with no impact on the initial batch of product after restarting.  An industrial process that could more or less instantaneously reach full capacity steady state operation would rank higher than an industrial process that would take a long time to reach full capacity steady state operation.

For AHP,  the range of the scale is from 1 to 9, with 1 representing when the two options are thought of as equal for the given characteristic. As can be seen below with the safety comparison of desalination to hydrogen production, you will have three initial options. If you choose that the desalination and hydrogen production are equally safe, that will be recorded as a 1 in the AHP. If you choose, for example, that hydrogen production is safer than desalination, then you will be directed to a second question which determines your view of how much safer hydrogen production is than desalination.

As AHP focuses on collecting expert opinions, you have been selected because you have either published research or a report on nuclear renewable hybrid energy systems, cogeneration, or have worked with a nuclear cogeneration system. I would appreciate it if I could include your name as participating in the research, as can be seen in the first question below.  Your answers will not be shared, only that you were part of the expert group taking this survey.

I recognize that characteristics such as regional accessibility of feedstocks for each of the industrial processes will have a major impact on which industrial process would be pursued in a nuclear renewable hybrid energy system. For the purposes of this research, please assume all regional characteristics are equal.  The goal of this research is to ascertain whether AHP can generally be applied to determining the relative values of different potential industrial processes for a nuclear renewable hybrid energy system.

Thank you for your time and willingness to participate in this research. If you have any questions about the survey, please contact me at:

The process first involved translating the responses into the ranges descriptive of each of the answers.  Then, the answers from each of the surveys was input into the program.  Then, a geometric mean was found for each of the responses.  Each of the options were then weighted based on the importance of the characteristics, in this case with safety having a much greater weighting than the other two characteristics.

The following images show some of the MSF and RO configurations included in this thesis.  The MSF system had multiple configurations along with many different temperatures attempted.  Initially, it was unclear if the best configuration would include sending higher temperature water to the MSF system.  After different experiments with the model, it was found that the best outcomes came from running the MSF at 80\degree C.

\chapter{Aspen HYSYS Water Composition Calculation}
In order to assess the purity of the water produced through the MSF system, the water input into the system needed to closely match the brackish groundwater found in Arizona.  In order to demonstrate a worst case scenario, the thesis multiplied the particulates in the system by about 10.  The table below demonstrates the dimensional analysis implemented in order to find the mole percent of each particulate.

\chapter{RAVEN Input Code}
The following code displays how the Arizona Public Service's hourly demand data was initially translated into daily time series in the eia datetime general python code.  Then, the convert multiple histories code displays taking the data and separating it into the seasons as defined by the Farmer's Almanac.  Finally, the train eia xml document displays the RAVEN input document for one season, in this case fall.  This xml document shows how the data is input into the system, which then trains the ARMA model to have similar statistical outcomes as the real data input into the system.  Finally, the Arizona fall document generates the synthetic data and plots it in the graphs included in this thesis.

% Below are the examples of code listings that Christopher Goes, Matthew Brown, Cara Leatherman, and
  % Chris Zeoli put together. First is a YAML file listing, which has a definition in the .cls file.
  % Listings can be anything, e.g full experiment results, a list of equipment used, etc. It is just
  % really handy for formatting code. To see how to define new code languages, see the .cls file.

% DO NOT PUT ANYTHING BESIDES COMMENTS AFTER THE END OF THE DOCUMENT! %
% A final tip: if you need to cut something out of your paper, rather than delete it, it's a good idea to move the text to another place. I like to have a scratch.tex file for this. Such a file is also pretty helpful for creating an outline, or quickly laying out ideas.
