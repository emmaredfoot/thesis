abstract = {This paper presents average values of levelized costs and levelized avoided costs for generating technologies entering service in 2019, 2022, 1 and 2040 as represented in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) for the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 (AEO2017) Reference case. 2 The costs for generating technologies entering service in 2022 are presented in the body of the report, with those for 2019 3 and 2040 included in Appendices A and B, respectively. Both a capacity-weighted average based on projected capacity additions across the 22 U.S. regions of the NEMS electricity market module (EMM) and a simple average of the regional values are provided, together with the range of regional values. Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and its limitations Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competiveness of different generating technologies. It represents the per-kilowatthour cost (in discounted real dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle 4 . Key inputs to calculating LCOE include capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance (O{\&}M) costs, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type. 5 The importance of the factors varies among the technologies. For technologies such as solar and wind generation that have no fuel costs and relatively small variable O{\&}M costs, LCOE changes in rough proportion to the estimated capital cost of generation capacity. For technologies with significant fuel cost, both fuel cost and overnight cost estimates significantly affect LCOE. The availability of various incentives, including state or federal tax credits (see text box), can also impact the calculation of LCOE. As with any projection, there is uncertainty about all of these factors and their values can vary regionally and across time as technologies evolve and fuel prices change. It is important to note that actual plant investment decisions are affected by the specific technological and regional characteristics of a project, which involve numerous other factors not reflected in LCOE values.

abstract = {As a subdiscipline of industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis is concerned with resource optimization among colocated companies. The industrial symbiosis complex in Kalundborg, Denmark is the seminal example of industrial symbiosis in the industrial ecology literature. In spite of this, there has been no in-depth quantitative analysis enabling more comprehensive understanding of economic and environmental performances connected to this case. In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and envi-ronmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged by-product or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental per-formance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.},

In the future, more flexible nuclear systems could enable wind to achieve a 50{\%} share of the renewable contribution to the energy mix. Small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) could provide firming power generation to back-up the supply from renewable resources and follow-load. This study involves the hypothetical combination of an off-shore wind farm and a SMR, operated together as a virtual power plant (VPP). Results using wind data from the North Sea indicate that the combination results in 80{\%} less wind power variation to the grid, effectively creating a virtual baseload power plant. This gain comes at the loss of 30{\%} SMR capacity utilization. The research identified that the reduction of 1000MW off-shore wind farm variability was best achieved with 700MW SMRs using 100MW modules. In demand-following mode the VPP could maneuver output to improve synchronization with demand by 60–70{\%} over a wind-only system. Power variability was indifferent to the SMR module size. The VPP could not reduce 100{\%} of the wind variation, as additional balancing measures (e.g., smart grid, storage, and hybrid-nuclear systems) are still needed.},

      abstract = {Future plans for energy production in the European Union as well as other locations call for a high penetration of renewable technologies (20{\%} by 2020, and higher after 2020). The remaining energy requirements will be met by fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Smaller, less-capital intensive nuclear reactors are emerging as an alternative to fossil fuel and large nuclear systems. Approximately 50 small ({\textless}300 MWe) to medium-sized ({\textless}700 MWe) reactors (SMRs) concepts are being pursued for use in electricity and cogeneration (combined heat and power) markets. However, many of the SMRs are at the early design stage and full data needed for economic analysis or market assessment is not yet available. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop “target cost” estimates for reactors deployed in a range of competitive market situations (electricity prices ranging from 45–150 €/MWh). Parametric analysis was used to develop a cost breakdown for reactors that can compete against future natural gas and coal (with/without carbon capture) and large nuclear systems. Sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impacts on competitiveness from key cost variables. This study suggests that SMRs may effectively compete in future electricity markets if their capital costs are controlled, favorable financing is obtained, and reactor capacity factors match those of current light water reactors. This methodology can be extended to cogeneration markets supporting a range of process heat applications.},

abstract = {Stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems usually incur lower costs and demonstrate higher reliability than photovoltaic (PV) or wind systems. The most usual systems are PV–Wind–Battery and PV–Diesel–Battery. Energy storage is usually in batteries (normally of the lead-acid type). Another possible storage alternative, such as hydrogen, is not currently economically viable, given the high cost of the electrolyzers and fuel cells and the low efficiency in the electricity–hydrogen–electricity conversion. When the design of these systems is carried out, it is usually done resolve an optimization problem in which the Net Present Cost (NPC) is minimized or, in some cases, in relation to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE). The correct resolution of this optimization problem is a complex task because of the high number of variables and the non-linearity in the performance of some of the system components. This paper revises the simulation and optimization techniques, as well as the tools existing that are needed to simulate and design stand-alone hybrid systems for the generation of electricity.},

abstract = {Dynamic analysis of HES (hybrid energy systems) under flexible operation and variable renewable generation is considered in this two-part communication to better understand various challenges and opportunities associated with the high variability arising from integrating renewable energy into the power grid. Unique consequences are addressed by devising advanced HES solutions in which multiple forms of energy commodities, such as electricity and chemical products, may be exchanged. Dynamic models of various unit operations are developed and integrated within two different HES options. One HES option, termed traditional, produces electricity only and consists of a primary heat generator, a steam turbine generator, a wind farm, and a battery storage. The other HES option, termed advanced, includes not only the components present in the traditional option but also a chemical plant complex to repurpose excess energy for non-electricity services, such as for the production of chemical goods. In either case, a given HES is connected to the power grid at a point of common coupling and requested to deliver a certain electricity generation profile as dictated by a regional power grid operator based on a predicted demand curve. A dynamic performance analysis of these highly-coupled HES is conducted in this part one of the communication to identify their key dynamical properties and limitations and to prescribe solutions for best managing and mitigating the high variability introduced from incorporating renewable energy into the energy mix.},

The first is an unconstrained optimization problem that optimizes intrinsic proper-ties of the base generation, power cycle, and electri-cal storage components to minimize variability in the HES. The second problem takes operating and capital costs into consideration by imposing linear and non-linear constraints on the design variables. Variability in electrical power applied to high temperature steam electrolysis is shown to be reduced by 18{\%} in the un-constrained case and 11{\%} in the constrained case.

This is particularly important when including renewable energy sources, whose output levels are inherently variable, deter-mined by nature. The specific HES configuration modeled in this paper include two energy inputs: a nuclear plant, and a series of wind turbines. In addition, the system produces two energy outputs: electricity and synthet-ic fuel. The models are verified through simulations of the individual components, and the system as a whole.

To study the dynamic analysis of such system, special attention is given here to the detailed dynamic modeling and control design of RO desalination process that employs a spiral-wound membrane module. In particular, the solution-diffusion model modified with the concentration polarization theory is applied to predict RO performance over a large range of operating conditions. Simulation results involving several case studies suggest that an RO desalination plant can provide operational flexibility to participate in energy management at the utility scale by dynamically optimizing the use of excess electrical energy. The incorporation of additional commodity (fresh water) produced from a FLR allows a broader range of HES operations for maximizing overall system performance and profitability.},

abstract = {The energy industries face two sustainability challenges: the need to avoid climate change and the need to replace traditional crude oil as the basis of our transport system. Radical changes in our energy system will be required to meet these challenges. These challenges may require tight coupling of different energy sources (nuclear, fossil, and renewable) to produce liquid fuels for transportation, match electricity production to electricity demand, and meet other energy needs. This implies a paradigm shift in which different energy sources are integrated together, rather than being considered separate entities that compete. Several examples of combined-energy systems are described. High-temperature nuclear heat may increase worldwide light crude oil resources by an order of magnitude while reducing greenhouse gas releases from the production of liquid fossil fuels. Nuclear-biomass liquid-fuels production systems could potentially meet world needs for liquid transport fuels. Nuclear-hydrogen peak power systems may enable renewable electricity sources to meet much of the world's electric demand by providing electricity when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

With ground source heat pump (GSHP) as the main body and core technology, the hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) system is used frequently in recent years and its integration and synthesis skills face higher requirements. The worldwide hybrid system has usually been composed of types of energy source devices, such as solar collector, boiler (coal, gas, oil), electric heater, waste energy device, cooling tower, cooler, and thermal storage system with natural cold and hot. Actually, they lead to the complicated unsteady processes and various hybrid energy systems. In China, the applications of these systems are growing year by year, but the new technology breakthrough is being in difficulty and even in an awkward situation. This paper review the progress of GSHP combined with HES all over the world, and surveyed the development of HGSHP in China. Meanwhile, the basic proposals for development in the future are presented to make up the gap in the field of HES and HGSHP. A coming work aims to research the basic problems during the demonstration application, such as investigation of system design parameters, component configuration and control strategies of a HGSHP system. These problems will strengthen theoretical and practical understanding of HES and facilitate more extensive application of HGSHP in China. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study was conducted for optimal design of hybrid power generation system (HPS) in which diesel generators and renewable energy generators are incorporated to supply electricity to islands isolated from the national grid. In order to optimally design capacity and operation planning of the hybrid system, hourly electricity demand data is needed over 8760h of a year. The required hourly data was simulated from monthly electricity consumption reports and EnergyPlus-based building models. An optimization method that matches hourly supply and demand may encounter problems of exhaustive computing time and ‘out of memory' because size of associated matrices increases in multiples of 8760×8760. The problems were resolved with sparse matrices and the linear programming algorithm. Linear constraints necessary for the linear programming were developed in this study. According to the simulation result with the target island (Deokjeok Island), the optimization method recommends a hybrid generation system rather than a conventional diesel only system due to high fuel cost. And the capacity design reflects renewable energy resources abundant in the island. And designed operation planning illustrates good hourly matching of demand and supply over 8760h with minimal excess electricity, which validates integrity of the proposed design method.},

In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system configuration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, economic and envi-ronmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.},

To cover this breadth of scenarios we analyse, with the help of simulation models, case studies with peak thermal capacities ranging from 2 to 10MW. Evaluations are made against technical, financial and environmental criteria. Suitable solar multiples, based on the trade-offs among the various criteria, range from 1 to 2.5. Compared to conventional energy sources, levelised energy costs are high – but competitive in comparison to other renewables such as photovoltaic and wind. Long payback periods for hybrid plants mean that they cannot compete directly with biomass-only systems. However, a 1.2–3.2 times increase in feedstock price will result in hybrid systems becoming cost competitive. Furthermore, in comparison to biomass-only, hybrid operation saves up to 29{\%} biomass and land with an 8.3–24.8{\$}/GJ/a and 1.8–5.2¢/kWh increase in cost per exergy loss and levelised energy cost. Hybrid plants will become an increasingly attractive option as the cost of solar thermal falls and feedstock, fossil fuel and land prices continue to rise. In the foreseeable future, solar will continue to rely on subsidies and it is recommended to subsidise preferentially tri-generation plants.},

abstract = {Due to a lack of indigenous fossil energy resources, Ireland's energy supply constantly teeters on the brink of political, geopolitical, and geographical unease. The potential risk to the security of the energy supply combined with the contribution of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to climate change gives a clear indication of Ireland's need to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels as primary energy source. A feasibility analysis to investigate the available renewable energy options was conducted using HOMER software. The net present cost, the cost of energy, and the CO2 emissions of each potential energy combination were considered in determining the most suitable renewable and non-renewable hybrid energy system. Wind energy was shown to have the greatest potential for renewable energy generation in Ireland: wind energy was a component of the majority of the optimal hybrid systems both in stand-alone and grid-connected systems. In 2010 the contribution of wind energy to gross electricity consumption in Ireland approximated 10{\%}, and the results of this feasibility study indicate that there is great potential for wind-generated energy production in Ireland. Due to the inherent variability of wind energy the grid-connected system results are particularly relevant, which show that in more than half of the analyses investigating electrical energy demand the incorporation of wind energy offset the CO2 emissions of the non-renewable elements to such a degree that the whole system had negative CO2 emissions, which has serious implications for Kyoto Protocol emissions limits. Ireland also has significant potential for hydropower generation despite only accounting for 2{\%} of the gross electricity consumption in 2010. Wind and hydro energy should therefore be thoroughly explored to secure an indigenous primary energy source in Ireland.},

abstract = {We examine the changes to the electric power system required to incorporate high penetration of variable wind and solar electricity generation in a transmission constrained grid. Simulations were performed in the Texas, US (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power meet up to 80{\%} of the electric demand. The primary constraints on incorporation of these sources at large scale are the limited time coincidence of the resource with normal electricity demand, combined with the limited flexibility of thermal generators to reduce output. An additional constraint in the ERCOT system is the current inability to exchange power with neighboring grids. By themselves, these constraints would result in unusable renewable generation and increased costs. But a highly flexible system – with must-run baseload generators virtually eliminated – allows for penetrations of up to about 50{\%} variable generation with curtailment rates of less than 10{\%}. For penetration levels up to 80{\%} of the system's electricity demand, keeping curtailments to less than 10{\%} requires a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about one day of average demand.},

The system uses nuclear energy to supply heat for the Rankine cycle and Mg–Cl cycle, where the power produced by the Rankine cycle is used to run the electrolysis steps of the Mg–Cl cycle and liquefaction cycle compressors. The four-step Mg–Cl cycle is specifically designed to decrease the electrical work consumption of the cycle by capturing HCl in dry form with an additional step to conventional three-step cycle. A performance assessment study is undertaken based on energy and exergy analysis of the subsystems, and total energy and exergy efficiencies of the plant are found to be 18.6{\%}, and 31.35{\%}.

abstract = {A strategy to enable zero-carbon variable electricity production with full utilization of renewable and nuclear energy sources has been developed. Wind and solar systems send electricity to the grid. Nuclear plants operate at full capacity with variable steam to turbines to match electricity demand with production (renewables and nuclear). Excess steam at times of low electricity prices and electricity demand go to hybrid fuel production and storage systems. The characteristic of these hybrid technologies is that the economic penalties for variable nuclear steam inputs are small. Three hybrid systems were identified that could be deployed at the required scale. The first option is the gigawatt-year hourly-to-seasonal heat storage system where excess steam from the nuclear plant is used to heat rock a kilometer underground to create an artificial geothermal heat source. The heat source produces electricity on demand using geothermal technology. The second option uses steam from the nuclear plant and electricity from the grid with high-temperature electrolysis (HTR) cells to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is primarily for industrial applications; however, the HTE can be operated in reverse using hydrogen for peak electricity production. The third option uses variable steam and electricity for shale oil production.},

abstract = {As the U.S. energy system evolves, the amount of electricity from variable-generation sources is likely to increase, which could result in additional times when electricity demand is lower than available production. Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements defined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be implemented using an interconnected architecture of different codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material movements. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncertainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclusion of an optimization engine able to optimize simultaneously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or discrete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the four functions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.},

In order to better understand the dynamic and probabilistic behavior of hybrid energy systems, this paper proposes a model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) to characterize historical weather measurements and to generate synthetic weather (e.g., wind speed) data. In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements with seasonal trends subtracted). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system configuration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. Requirements on component ramping rate, economic and envi-ronmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.},

abstract = {The worldwide demand for potable water has been steadily growing and is projected to accelerate while natural reserves of fresh water are generally flat or diminishing. Desalination of seawater or brackish groundwater is expected to make up the difference; however, the desalination of water is energy intensive, requiring large amounts of electricity and/or thermal energy. Nuclear energy is an attractive option for large scale desalination application since the thermal energy produced in a nuclear plant can provide both electricity and heat for clean water production without the emission of greenhouse gases or the variability of renewable sources. A particularly attractive option for nuclear desalination is to couple a desalination plant with a new generation of designs - small modular reactors. The NuScale small modular reactor design is especially well suited for the cogeneration of electricity and clean water because of the enhanced safety, improved affordability, and deployment flexibilities of the plant design, which provides a cost-effective approach to expanding global desalination capacity. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the technical and economic considerations of coupling a NuScale plant to a variety of different desalination technologies. The study concludes that although a NuScale plant coupled to a reverse osmosis desalination plant provides the most favorable economics, NuScale design features offer several flexibilities for coupling to thermal distillation plants and hybrid plant configurations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs) provide a unique opportunity for future nuclear development with reduced financial risks, allowing the United States to meet growing energy demands through safe, reliable, clean air electricity generation while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the reliance on unstable fossil fuel prices. A nuclear power plant is comprised of several complex subsystems which utilize materials from other subsystems and their surroundings. The economic utility of resources, or thermoeconomics, is extremely difficult to analyze, particularly when trying to optimize resources and costs among individual subsystems and determine prices for products. Economics and thermodynamics cannot provide this information individually. Thermoeconomics, however, provides a method of coupling the quality of energy available based on exergy and the value of this available energy – " exergetic costs " . For an SMR exergy analysis, both the physical and economic environments must be considered. The physical environment incorporates the energy, raw materials, and reference environment, where the reference environment refers to natural resources available without limit and without cost, such as air input to a boiler. The economic environment includes market influences and prices in addition to installation, operation, and maintenance costs required for production to occur. The exergetic cost or the required exergy for production may be determined by analyzing the physical environment alone. However, to optimize the system economics, this environment must be coupled with the economic environment. A balance exists between enhancing systems to improve efficiency and optimizing costs. Prior research into SMR thermodynamics has not detailed methods on improving exergetic costs for an SMR coupled with storage technologies and renewable energy such as wind or solar in a hybrid energy system. This process requires balancing technological efficiencies and economics to demonstrate financially competitive systems. This paper aims to explore the use of exergy analysis methods to estimate and optimize SMR resources and costs for individual subsystems, based on thermodynamic principles – resource utilization and efficiency. The paper will present background information on exergy theory; identify the core subsystems in an SMR plant coupled with storage systems in support of renewable energy and hydrogen production; perform a thermodynamic exergy analysis; determine the cost allocation among these subsystems; and calculate unit exergetic costs, unit exergoeconomic costs, and first and second law efficiencies. Exergetic and exergoeconomic costs ultimately determine how individual subsystems contribute to overall profitability and how efficiencies and consumption may be optimized to improve profitability, making SMRs more competitive with other generation technologies.},

The industrial symbiosis complex in Kalundborg, Denmark is the seminal example of industrial symbiosis in the industrial ecology literature. In spite of this, there has been no in-depth quantitative analysis enabling more comprehensive understanding of economic and environmental performances connected to this case. In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and envi-ronmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged by-product or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental per-formance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.},

abstract = {In this paper, a large MSF distillation plant in the gulf area is analyzed thermodynamically using actual plant operation data. Exergy flow rates are evaluated throughout the plant, and the exergy flow diagram is prepared. The rates of exergy destruction and their percentages are indicated on the diagram so that the locations of highest exergy destruction can easily be identified. The highest exergy destruction (77.7{\%}) occurs within the MSF unit, as expected, and this can be reduced by increasing the number of flashing stages. The exergy destruction in the pumps and motors account for 5.3{\%} of the total, and this also can be reduced by using high efficiency motors and pumps. The plant is determined to have a second law efficiency of just 4.2{\%}, which is very low. This indicates that there are major opportunities in the plant to reduce exergy destruction and, thus, the amount of electric and thermal energy supplied, making the operation of the plant more cost effective.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The energy market supply is under pressure to achieve competing goals, such as minimizing the cost of electricity and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving grid resilience and reliability and meeting regulatory requirements. To study different scenarios for possible evolutions of the energy market that assume a certain renewable penetration and the possible introduction of hybrid nuclear reactors, the HYBRID modeling and simulation project has been initiated by INL [1]. The term hybrid nuclear reactor here refers to nuclear power plants that not only produce electricity, but can also sell heat to an industrial process, like a hydrogen generation or water desalination plant. The RAVEN (Risk Analysis Virtual ENvironment) code developed at INL [2] together with the modeling language Modelica [3] (the Dymola compiler is used) have been selected as the main modeling tools for the HYBRID modeling and simulation project. This summary outlines the challenge, presents an overview of the developments in the RAVEN code needed to solve it and shows an illustrative example calculation. The HYBRID modeling and simulation project is a multi laboratory effort, involving research teams from three different U.S. national laboratories, led by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and supported by the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). BACKGROUND One of the goals of the HYBRID modeling and simulation project is to assess the economic viability of hybrid systems in a market that contains renewable energy sources like wind. The Nuclear Hybrid Energy System (NHES) would include a nuclear reactor that not only generates electricity, but also produces by-products utilizing excess heat/electricity, like hydrogen or desalinated water. The idea is that the possibility of selling non-electric energy provides cushion to the volatility introduced by the renewable energy sources [4]. The problem to solve is to find the optimal configuration of an NHES that will minimize the cost of electricity, while accounting for defined constraints on the capability of the NHES to meet demand. These constraints have a fundamental role in enabling the economic evaluation framework by monetizing the ability of the NHES being analyzed to better cope with electricity demand volatility. The introduction of such constraints leads to the calculation of an effective cost of electricity that differs from the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) since the cost of electricity is computed a posteriori to account for the effective utilization of each subsystem. The system that is studied is modular and made of an assembly of components. For example, a system could contain a nuclear reactor, a gas turbine, a battery, a by-product production subsystem and, possibly, renewables. This system could correspond to the size of a balance area, but in theory any size of system is imaginable. The system is modeled in the 'Modelica' language. To assess the economics of the system, an optimization procedure will be performed to obtain a set of parameters, which defines the configuration of the NHES to find the minimal cost of electricity. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the software framework for the NHES modeling and optimization. As one can see, the statistics and optimization code RAVEN is used as a driver for the whole problem. RAVEN is running the optimization, i.e. RAVEN changes the input parameters in the system model, provides the needed time histories for demand, wind, etc., runs the Dymola system model, collects output from Dymola and assesses the next optimization step. As mentioned, the figure of merit for the optimization is the cost of electricity. The Dymola output is used in a simple cash flow analysis that will reveal the cost of electricity. The optimization routine seeks various combinations of input variables (according to a defined optimization algorithm) to find the minimum cost of electricity while the system is requested to cope with random synthetic time histories of electricity demand and renewable supply. The analysis does not rely on bidding on marginal cost for every hour, but tries to find the minimal cost to produce a certain amount of electricity with a given time profile, e.g. for a representative week or year. This means that the number of parameters to optimize is high. In addition to the mean demand and the component capacities, the utilization factor for every hour for every component is also an optimization parameter. The number of optimization parameters for a one-month optimization with a three-component system would be 2164:},

Recently some studies have concentrated on selecting the best energy policy and determining the best energy alternatives. In most of these studies, multicriteria and fuzzy approaches to energy policy making are frequently used. The fuzzy set theory is a powerful tool to treat the uncertainty in case of incomplete or vague information. In this paper, a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making methodology is suggested for the selection among energy policies. The methodology is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows the evaluation scores from experts to be linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, the best energy policy is determined for Turkey.},

The present study is aimed at clarifying the issue in case individual expert judgements are provided as pair comparisons in the fundamental scale and aggregated using AHP methodology. Expert estimates are modelled based on presumptions that they are distributed according to exponential and absolute normal distribution laws. Experiment results confirm the presumption that under large expert numbers, the competence of individual experts matters less significantly but if the number of experts in a group is relatively small, expert competence should always be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent years, the increasing threat to groundwater quality due to human activities has become a matter of great concern. The groundwater quality problems present today are caused by contamination and by overexploitation, or by combination of both, which are faced by many Indian states. Today, reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are the leading technology for desalination of groundwater because of their strong separation capabilities and exhibiting a great potential for treatment of waters worldwide. However, the RO process had some problems due to the formation of polarization films because high pressure operation and by-products which may generate bacteria and fouling. Also, high energy consumption and brine disposal problem is faced in RO process due to the limited recovery of water. These problems may be overcome by other membrane thermal process such as a membrane distillation (MD). This paper addresses the outline of RO and MD process for desalination. RO has developed over the past 40 years and MD is an emerging technology for brackish water desalination and yet is not fully implemented in industry. The MD is the better alternative to RO for desalination theoretically found in the literature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Lokhov2011,
abstract = {T raditionally, nuclear power plants (NPPs) have been considered as baseload sources of electricity as they rely on a technology with high fixed costs and low variable costs. In the beginning of the nuclear era, the share of nuclear power in the overall energy mix was usually small, and adjustments of electric load in response to variations in electricity demand could be left to technologies with different economic and technological characteristics, most notably low fixed cost and high variable cost gas plants. However, this simple state of affairs no longer applies in all countries. The share of nuclear power in the national electricity mix of some countries has become so large that the utilities have had to implement or to improve the manoeuvrability capabilities of their NPPs in order to be able to adapt electricity supply to daily, seasonal or other variations in power demand. This is the case in France where more than 75{\%} of electricity is generated by NPPs, and where some nuclear reactors operate in load-following mode (see Figure 1). Another incentive for load-following with nuclear power plants has recently arisen from the large-scale deployment of intermittent electricity sources like wind power. The growing deployment of inter-mittent sources in several NEA member countries has introduced significant and irregular variations in the power supply and has made balancing elec-tricity supply and demand increasingly difficult. The challenge is not only technical. Due to the sud-den influx of large amounts of wind power, German power markets have experienced several hours of negative electricity prices in recent years and many more hours with prices that were lower than the variable costs of nuclear power plants, which have the lowest variable costs among the large-scale established power sources. For these reasons, some German utilities have started operating their NPPs in load-following mode (see Figure 2).},

@article{Bodalal2010,
abstract = {This paper describes the development of a mathematical model to predict the performance of multi-stage flash (MSF) plant systems under transient conditions. The model developed is based on coupling the dynamic equations of mass, energy and momentum. These equations describe the dynamic behavior of brine and product streams within the flashing stages, the effect of salinity and temperature variation on the specific heat, boiling point, enthalpy and density is accounted for in this model. The model which consists of a set of differential and algebraic equations (describing the dynamic behavior of each stage in terms of some key physical parameters) are solved by using the fifth order Runge-Kutta method. The proposed model was validated by using data from previous theoretical studies as well as actual data obtained from an operating MSF plant. The results obtained are useful for dynamic parametric studies and for the prediction of the performance of a given plant under a wide range of possible transient conditions.},
